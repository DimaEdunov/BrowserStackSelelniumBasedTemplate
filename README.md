# BrowserStackSelelniumBasedTemplate
This projects consists the following stack : Selenium, WebDriver, Allure, Pytest, Pytest Email Reports, parallel run &amp; Integration with BrowserStack!

To integrate into BrowserStack you first need to open BrowserStack account (At least for 1 parralel run account).
There in 'Automate' section you can get an 'Automated key' & 'user name'. Once you have those you can choose any OS and any BROWSER type you wanna run your Selenium-based automatiot
tested cases.

In this project I've set initial setup for Chrome and Safari.
Enjoy !

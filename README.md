# BrowserStackSelelniumBasedTemplate
This projects consists the following stack : Selenium, WebDriver, Allure, Pytest, Pytest Email Reports, parallel run &amp; Integration with BrowserStack!

In case you are running on Windows OS on toy machine, you will not be able to automate websites using WebDriver on top of latest Safari browser versions.
Safari is not supported for Windows, but we can't forget there are lots of Mac / iPhone users out there and as an QA Automation team you need to make sure that they enjoy your web-product in the highest standarts as well.

To integrate into BrowserStack you first need to open BrowserStack account (At least for 1 parralel run account).
There in 'Automate' section you can get an 'Automated key' & 'user name'. Once you have those you can choose any OS and any BROWSER type you wanna run your Selenium-based automatiot
tested cases.

In this project I've set initial setup for Chrome and Safari.
Enjoy !
